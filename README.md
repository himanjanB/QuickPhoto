# QuickPhoto
QuickPhoto is an android app which shows all the photos stored in a phone in reverse chronological order.

This is a very basic app to slide all the images available in the gallery. Not very well designed and is not very stable. However as a first project, I am pretty proud of myself having build this. 

It starts with the latest photos that were stored in the device. It keeps sliding at a interval of 3 seconds. In case the user exits the app in between, it continues from where it left. However if the user has added new photos in between, the app shows the new pictures and then continue from the one that was pending. 

Feel free to tweak and use it.
